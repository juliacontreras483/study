# Exercise 100
# Write a function named get_average_spent_per_item that takes in the shopping cart and returns the average of summing each item's quanties times that item's price.
# Hint: You may need to set an initial total price and total total quantity to zero, then sum up and divide that total price by the total quantity

assert get_average_spent_per_item(shopping_cart) == 1.333529411764706
print("Exercise 100 is complete.")

# Exercise 101
# Write a function named most_spent_on_item that takes in the shopping cart as input and returns the dictionary associated with the item that has the highest price*quantity.
# Be sure to do this as programmatically as possible.
# Hint: Similarly to how we sometimes begin a function with setting a variable to zero, we need a starting place:
# Hint: Consider creating a variable that is a dictionary with the keys "price" and "quantity" both set to 0. You can then compare each item's price and quantity total to the one from "most"

assert most_spent_on_item(shopping_cart) == {
    "title": "chocolate",
    "price": 0.75,
    "quantity": 9
}
print("Exercise 101 is complete.")
